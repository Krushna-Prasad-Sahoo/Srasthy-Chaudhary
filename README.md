I'm a Electronics and communication engineering B.tech student

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning new technologies and creating projects to solve problems by integration  of different technologies

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about different technologies like **Cloud Computing (AWS, GCP, Azure), Machine Learning, Big Data (Hadoop, Hive) and DevOps Tools Like (Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins)**

- 👯 I have a technical blog on Medium: url:- chaudharysrasthy1528.medium.com where I have written about all the project that. I have done till date with tutorial. ***Do check it***

- 💬 I love acquiring new skills other than tech stuff like **Blogging, Data Science, Business Growth, Entrepreneurship, MLOps (I have gained knowledge about these topics and trying to learn more)**

- ⚡ Fun fact: People Think that an individual should focus only on one thing at a time and don't be a Jack of all trades, master of none, but I think in today's world an individual can acquire many skills at the same time and then work on those skills by integrating them and create a system to solve a problem.

- Experience in Technical Field: I am doing Training with **LinuxWorldInformatics PVT Ltd** https://www.linuxworldindia.org/ and Learning all the above mentioned technologies within 1.5 years and fully utilized the lockdown period to enhance and gain technical skills.
